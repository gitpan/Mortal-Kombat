NAME
    Mortal::Kombat - Mortal Kombat program termination

SYNOPSIS
      use Mortal::Kombat;
      # ...
      # exit successfully
      flawless victory;

      use Mortal::Kombat;
      $screwedup and fatality "Scorpion has whomped you,";

DESCRIPTION
    This is a gimmick module. It merely gives you three functions,
    flawless(), victory(), and fatality(), each of which can be used
    without parentheses for a nice english look.

    The suggested uses are:

      flawless victory;  # same as 'exit 0'

    and

      fatality "some error message";  # same as die "some error message";

    That's it. If you've got any suggestions, you can email me.
    Don't be ashamed.
